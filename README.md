# Book Store Management System (Java & JDBC)

This project is a comprehensive Book Store Management System built using Java and connected to a MySQL database via JDBC. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books and authors, managing the inventory and author information effectively.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Book Management**: Add, view, update, and delete book records.
*   **Author Management**: Add, view, update, and delete author details.

*   **Console-Based UI**: A straightforward and interactive command-line interface to manage the bookstore.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Programming Language**: Java
*   **Database**: MySQL
*   **API/Driver**: Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)

## üì¶ Database Schema

The database consists of two primary tables: `authors` and `books`. A one-to-many relationship exists where one author can write multiple books.

### Authors Table
This table stores information about the authors.
