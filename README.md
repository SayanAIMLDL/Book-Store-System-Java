# Book Store Management System (Java & JDBC)

This project is a comprehensive Book Store Management System built using Java and connected to a MySQL database via JDBC. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books and authors, managing the inventory and author information effectively.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Book Management**: Add, view, update, and delete book records.
*   **Author Management**: Add, view, update, and delete author details.
*   **Database Connectivity**: Utilizes Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) with a MySQL connector to ensure persistent data storage.
*   **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Organizes code into distinct layers (DAO, Service, Model) for better maintainability and scalability.
*   **Console-Based UI**: A straightforward and interactive command-line interface to manage the bookstore.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Programming Language**: Java
*   **Database**: MySQL
*   **API/Driver**: Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)

## üì¶ Database Schema

The database consists of two primary tables: `authors` and `books`. A one-to-many relationship exists where one author can write multiple books.

### Authors Table
This table stores information about the authors.

)

### Books Table
This table stores details about the books, including a foreign key `author_id` that links to the `authors` table.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SayanAIMLDL/Book-Store-System-Java.git
    ```
2.  **Configure the Database**:
    *   Create a MySQL database.
    *   Update the database connection details (URL, username, password) in `src/com/group7/bookstore/util/DatabaseUtil.java`.
    *   Execute the SQL script to create the `authors` and `books` tables.![initial](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f365d475-d012-4c52-88a2-f84d4c2e58e9)


3.  **Add the MySQL JDBC Driver**:
    *   Ensure the `mysql-connector-j` library is included in your project's build path.

4.  **Run the Application**:
    *   Compile and run the `Main.java` file to start the application.
